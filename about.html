<h2>My Journey</h2>
   <p>I started my career in supply chain management, gaining hands-on experience with inventory and demand planning. I currently work at Wilcon Depot Inc. as a Demand Planner Assistant, where I improve stock availability, optimize inventory across branches, and support smoother store operations.</p>
<h2>Learning Web Development</h2>
   <p>I’m passionate about learning new skills, which led me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through freeCodeCamp’s self-paced courses. I love that I can study at my own pace, and I plan to continue learning more courses to expand my web development knowledge. This website is my first step into coding, a space to practice, experiment, and showcase my growth.</p>
<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
   <p>Outside of work and coding, I enjoy singing, listening to music, watching movies, and exploring skills that will benefit me in the long run.</p>
